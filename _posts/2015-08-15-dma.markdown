>Obligatory quote

Start it off...

Armed with a newfound mastery of (digital synthesis)[], it is now time to venture into the
musical front, painting with the nearly unlimited variety of colors and textures
provided by the digital palette on our STM32F4 microcontroller. But before you
can break into your favorite Electric Piano 2 riff, or bust out a mellow
Fantasia groove, we need to figure out how to actually send data to the DAC.
