So, you decided embedded programming is what the hip kids do these days.  You
got super excited at the sight of an ARM Cortex M4 eval board for fifteen measly
dollars, you bought it, ideas saturate your brain and you can't wait to wring
out your thoughts into this thing. But it just sits there on your table begging
for sweet binary nectar. How do you feed it?

For the past four months I have been running the limited version of Keil,
chained to the measly 32kB debug limit I was quickly limited to debugging
diassembly. While that works great for debugging assembly code, the lack of
debugging information in the disassembly made working with C code a
nightmare. So it's time to ditch the VM and head back to the wonderful, organic
world of FOSS. Besides, I also switched over to a notebook running Debian and
Stallman would probably come after me with a katana if I ran Keil.

##Tools Required:
- [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)\\
- [GNU ARM Eclipse plugin](gnuarmeclipse.livius.net/blog/)\\
- - Includes the [GNU ARM Embedded toolchain (arm-none-eabi-gcc)]()
