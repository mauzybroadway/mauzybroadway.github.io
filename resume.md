##Education

**University of Maryland** - <sub><sup>College Park, MD</sup></sub>  
<sup>*B.S. Computer Engineering  - December 2015*</sup>  
As a CE major, I have had the opportunity to understand the full scope of all
things "computer": Microelectronics, digital logic, hardware design, computer
design, embedded systems, operating systems, systems programming, data
structures, and object oriented programming.

**Universit√§t Kassel** - <sub><sup>Kassel, Germany</sup></sub>  
<sup>*Study Abroad - Winter, 2015*</sup>  
The program focused on sustainablility engineering exploring such
technologies as: solar, wind, hydroelectric, biofuels, and geothermal energy
generation. I learned the basics of technical implementation, the
technical and political successes and pitfalls of each technology, as well as
the grid-level system design in Germany and Europe.

##Employment

**Joint Quantum Institute** - <sub><sup>College Park, MD</sup></sub>  
<sup>*June 2015 - present*</sup>  
I am working on an experimental control system which automates the process of
trapping ions for use in quantum information systems. The core of the program
runs on an FPGA which implements a soft-core processor to execute a custom set
of assembler commands in parallel, thus giving precise and deterministic control
over the experiment. The front-end of the system includes a PyQt interface with
a high-level compiled language for easier code implementation, data plots to
track ion fluoresence, and debugging tools.

**AT&T Government Solutions** - <sub><sup>Columbia, MD</sup></sub>  
<sup>*June 2014 - August 2014*</sup>  
I led a group of three interns in devleoping a tool to detect DNS tunneling in a
real-time high-traffic network. To accomplish this, we designed and administered
a network of 20 CentOS virtual machines to generate tunneled traffic for
training a machine learning classifier in Python (scikits-learn). We then
used this classifier in an application which sniffed live network flow data
and flagged suspicious activity.

**TRX Systems, Inc.** - <sub><sup>Greenbelt, MD</sup></sub>  
<sup>*September 2013 - February 2014*</sup>  
I worked to add features to TRX's indoor-location service. Specifically
developing firmware
for an ARM-based microcontroller to recalibrate a magnetometer in the presence
of on-chip magnetization as well as an indoor-outdoor sensor.
